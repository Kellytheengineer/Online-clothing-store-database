# Online Clothing Store Database

## Description

This project involves creating a comprehensive database for an online clothing store. The database consists of **five tables** and is designed to handle various store operations efficiently. Joins and views are utilized to retrieve specific results, and a custom **function** was developed to apply discounts on orders exceeding **£150**.

## Key Features

- **Five Tables**: Designed and created using best practices for relational databases.
- **Joins & Views**: Used for retrieving specific sets of data efficiently.
- **Discount Function**: Automatically applies discounts for qualifying orders (over £150).

## Reflection

The **sequence of table creation** and command execution was critical in ensuring smooth database setup and functionality. Starting with an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** allowed me to visualize the relationships between different entities clearly. This step helped in **optimizing the database structure** for efficient data management and retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- **Database**: MySQL
- **Query Language**: SQL
- **Diagramming Tool**: ERD

## Files

1. **`seed_and_table_creation.sql`**: Contains the SQL script for seeding the database and creating the tables.
2. **`queries_and_functions.sql`**: Includes the queries used for joins, views, and the discount function.
3. **`ERD_Diagram.png`**: Visual representation of the database schema showing the relationships between tables.

## How to Use

1. **Set up the Database**: Run the script in `seed_and_table_creation.sql` to create and seed the necessary tables.
2. **Run Queries**: Use the `queries_and_functions.sql` file to apply specific queries and the discount function.
3. **View ERD**: Refer to the `ERD_Diagram.png` for a visual understanding of the database structure.

## Future Improvements

- Implement user authentication for order tracking.
- Expand the product catalog and add filtering options for various clothing categories.
- Introduce advanced reporting features for sales and customer trends.
